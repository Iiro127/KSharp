## Numbers:

A num-variable can be initialized using the "num"-keyword. Nums can then be used to perform addition and subtraction.

**Example:**
```text
>>> num x = 2
>>> num y = 3
>>> num x + y
5
```

## Strings:

A str-variable can be initialized using the "str"-keyword. Like nums, str-variables can also be added together.

**Example:**
```text
>>> str x = ab
>>> str y = cd
>>> str x + y
abcd
```
## Printing:

Printing can be done using the "print"-keyword.

**Example:**
```text
>>> print hello world!
hello world!
>>> str car = audi
>>> print car
audi
```

## When:

"When" checks if a condition is fulfilled before performing an action.

**Example:**
```text
>>> str name = harry
>>> when (age = harry) { print welcome }
welcome
```
