## Numbers:

A num-variable can be initialized using the "num"-keyword. Nums can then be used to perform addition and subtraction.

```text
>>> num x = 2
>>> num y = 3
>>> num x + y
5
```

## Strings:

A str-variable can be initialized using the "str"-keyword. Like nums, str-variables can also be added together.

```text
>>> str x = ab
>>> str y = cd
>>> str x + y
abcd
```
## Printing:

**Printing variables:**

Printing variables can be done using the "print"-keyword.

```text
>>> str car = audi
>>> print car
audi
```

**Printing plain text:**

Printing plain text can be done by ending the body with "//".

```text
>>> print car//
car
```



## When:

"When" checks if a condition is fulfilled before performing an action.

```text
>>> str name = harry
>>> when (age = harry) { print welcome }
welcome
```
